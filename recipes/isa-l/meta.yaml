  patches:
        # Conda adds some CFLAGS to the environment which are not properly 
        # filtered by the original nasm-filter.sh
        # This patch also makes sure the nasm executable from the BUILD_PREFIX is used.

requirements:
  build:
    # igzip needs to be compiled with 7.5.0 to prevent an issue:
    # https://github.com/conda-forge/isa-l-feedstock/issues/7
    - {{ compiler('c') }}
    - nasm  # [not osx]
    # Osx needs some flags that are available from 2.14 on
    - nasm >=2.14  # [osx]
    - autoconf  # [unix]
    - automake  # [unix]
    - libtool   # [unix]
    - make      # [unix]

  commands:
    - igzip --help  # [unix]
        # Test compression and decompression. 
    - igzip -k LICENSE  # [unix]
        # Original file should be larger than compressed file.
    - bash -c '[ $(stat -c %s LICENSE) -gt $(stat -c %s LICENSE.gz) ]'  # [unix]

  description: |
    ISA-L is a collection of optimized low-level functions targeting storage applications. ISA-L includes:
    Erasure codes - Fast block Reed-Solomon type erasure codes for any encode/decode matrix in GF(2^8).
    CRC - Fast implementations of cyclic redundancy check. Six different polynomials supported.
        iscsi32, ieee32, t10dif, ecma64, iso64, jones64.
    Raid - calculate and operate on XOR and P+Q parity found in common RAID implementations.
    Compression - Fast deflate-compatible data compression.
    De-compression - Fast inflate-compatible data compression.
    This package includes the igzip program on Linux and MacOS.
